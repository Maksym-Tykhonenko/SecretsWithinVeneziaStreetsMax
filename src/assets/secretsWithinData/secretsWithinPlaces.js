Surrounded by arcades of ancient palaces, it serves as the public "salon of Europe" with historic cafes, where the melodies of street musicians have been heard for more than two centuries. In the morning, a soft mist reigns here, enveloping the mosaics of the facades and reflecting off the surface of the water of the Grand Canal. In the evening, the flickering of lanterns emphasizes the elegance of the colonnades and decorates each column with a trembling play of light. The square seems to breathe history, encouraging travelers to take a closer look at the details of the city's architecture.`,
